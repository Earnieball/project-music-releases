# Music Releases
This is a single page application which shoes an album and single releases. 
This app made with React.js framwork. 

* We made 5 files and import all of them to one main file (Header.jsx) and from import Header to App.jsx.  
* We have one cover image and Album name and Artist name. 
* In the album we made a link to Spotify. And by Hovering on the cove image the icons are displaying.
* The play icon has extra hover effect which it is becoming bigger  and have Transform effect. 
* We made a responsive showing 4 albums per row on desktop, 2 row on tablet, 1 row on mobile.


## The problem

Making props and connecting all files to the app and map function one of the biggest issues which we struggle which we had it. 
And in CSS part, hovering and icons was not easy neither.  

We work in with in Agile methodology we were made our components and try to understand how the props can transform all dada to the other files. 

If we had more time we could work on responsive in different way, for example in phone size use img[2] and on tablet  img[1] and on the big screen use img[0].
